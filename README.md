# mat_p2ip_prj
The codebase associated with the paper "MaTPPIp : a sequence driven, feature mixed protein-protein interaction prediction architecture with eXplainable AI based attribute assessment"

(*) There are redundancies in the codebase (specially in 'mtf_p2ip' folder) as we used to run different sets of experiments concurrently on a single machine.

(*) 'origMan' in the codebase implies 2-Dimensional Manually curated Features. Similary 'auxTl' and 'OtherMan' correspond to 1-Dimensional Transfer Learning based Features and 1-Dimensional Manually curated Features respectively. 

(*) Some abbreviations used in the codebase are:
AD: Alzheimer Disease; DS: Different Species (Mosuse, Fly, Worm, Yeast, Ecoli)


### (\*) remove all the comments by using regular expression:  #.* with blank (no space) at the end, after taking a backup of codebase with all the comments.
